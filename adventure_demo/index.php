                <p>
                    AdventureDem0 is a partnership between a bunch of people who are 
                    really super good at the things that they do. Those are interesting and 
                    valuable things too. We are sure you would agree if you knew the people 
                    and the things. Games are involved, probably, since games is the thing 
                    we do, and a game is the thing we want you to buy.<br>
                    <br>
                    We will be building a website for AdventureDem0, a AAA video game 
                    releasing approximately one year after the site goes live. The site 
                    is to be the game’s primary consumer-facing source of information and 
                    updates through the development and release process. Developer content, 
                    pre-release previews, sales information and tie-in merchandise are 
                    all facets of the pre-release consumer experience that the site will 
                    provide. It will allow consumers to discover, engage with and 
                    ultimately participate in the game experience through several 
                    distinct avenues. The site is a vital element in build AdventureDem0 
                    as part of a consumer’s purchasing identity and making the game an 
                    ongoing part of a consumer-based franchise environment through video 
                    content, development and IP blogs, tie-in merchandise and general 
                    game information.
                    <br>
                    Want to know more? Of course you do! We have all sorts of things to  
                    talk about, especially AdventureDem0.
