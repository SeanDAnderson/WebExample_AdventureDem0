# WebExample_AdventureDem0

This is my (admitedly basic) webpage from my Master of Science in Software Engineering general web course at Regis University.

All of the unusual functionality you will find is intended, they are demonstrations of PHP or JavaScript functionality.
Notable examples include:
*Image text changes size on mouse hover over image and image disappears on click.
*the "Favorite Mage" field on "Create New Account" page always reverts to Khadgar on focus loss.
*The FAQ responses are glib.

All of the assets on the page are by me (including images).

Creating a new account does not actually submit any SQL data to a server in the current build because there is not server to 
send it to. During the course all SQL was done locally. Instead, is simply returns you to the index page.
